## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within the project, we kindly ask you to help us keep the project secure. Please refrain from publicly disclosing the issue until we've had the opportunity to address it.

To report a vulnerability:

1. Please email us at **[your-email@example.com]** with the details of the issue, including:
    - A description of the vulnerability.
    - Steps to reproduce the issue.
    - The potential impact and any possible mitigation strategies.
2. We will review and respond to the report as quickly as possible.
3. Once the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a fix and notify you when the issue is resolved. We aim to do this in a timely manner and appreciate your patience.

Please do not use GitHub Issues for reporting security vulnerabilities.

We value your effort to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities, and we'll credit you in the release notes (unless you prefer otherwise).
